# Literally just a blank page

I made this so I could put it on my second monitor when I'm working or otherwise need to concentrate, the blank screen helps protect me from distractions while I focus on the primary screen.

Originally it was just black, now it's `#3c3c3c` cause it's the same color as my Chrome toolbar background.

Maybe I should make two .html files, one black and one `#3c3c3c`? Dunno, too lazy right now.

Bye.
